Hello! I am a senior undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning.

I am currently applying to Statistics Ph.D. programs for the Fall 2025 admission cycle. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this page with my future research.

I grew up in New Jersey. In my free time I like to rock climb and play volleyball with friends!
